# Reputation Warfare

Build and deploy reputation as a strategic asset that works while you rest. Let your reputation precede you like a shadow.

**Source Expert:** Genghis Khan
**Category:** Strategy / Negotiation

---

## When to Use

- Entering negotiations where perception matters
- Building competitive deterrence
- Establishing market position in a new space
- Dealing with repeated interactions (same competitors, partners, customers)
- When you need others to take you seriously before you've proven yourself to them
- After a significant victory or achievement

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "How do I negotiate from strength?"
- "How do I build my reputation?"
- "They don't take me seriously"
- "How do I deter competitors?"
- "I want them to fear competing with us"
- "How do I get leverage before we even talk?"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `objective` | Yes | What you want reputation to achieve |
| `audience` | Yes | Who needs to perceive you a certain way |
| `current_reputation` | Yes | What they currently believe about you |
| `available_evidence` | No | Actions/achievements you can point to |

## Workflow
### Step 1: The Mongol Reputation Doctrine

> "Reputation is an army that fights while you rest."

Genghis Khan weaponized reputation systematically:
- Cities that heard of his destruction of Bukhara surrendered without siege
- Refugees were deliberately allowed to flee and spread exaggerated tales
- Terms were always offered first - surrender was rewarded; resistance was annihilated
- Reputation for absolute follow-through made threats credible

The result: Many conquests required no battle. Cities calculated the odds and chose submission. Reputation did the work.

### Step 2: Framework

**1. Define the Reputation You Need**
What behavior do you want from your audience? Work backward:
- If competitors should avoid your market, they need to believe challenging you is costly
- If partners should give favorable terms, they need to believe you have alternatives
- If customers should trust you, they need to believe you deliver
- If talent should join you, they need to believe you're where winners go

**2. Identify the Consistent Behaviors**
Reputation is built through consistent patterns, not single events:
- What action, repeated over time, will create the perception you need?
- What must you ALWAYS do when a certain situation arises?
- What must you NEVER do, regardless of temptation?

**3. Build the Evidence Base**
Reputation requires proof. Create verifiable evidence:
- Public victories that can be referenced
- Documented follow-through on commitments
- Third-party validation (press, awards, testimonials)
- Visible consequences for those who tested you

**4. Communicate Through Action, Not Claims**
- Claims without evidence are ignored
- Actions speak across language and culture
- Let others tell your story (refugees, satisfied customers, defeated competitors)
- Silence about your capabilities can be more powerful than boasting

**5. Apply the Principle of Consistent Consequence**
- If you threaten something, you MUST follow through
- If you promise something, you MUST deliver
- One exception destroys years of reputation building
- Be known for absolute reliability in both reward and punishment

**6. Let Others Spread the Word**
- Refugees fleeing your victories carry the message
- Happy customers become references
- Former competitors acknowledge your strength
- The market talks; make sure what they say serves you

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input:**
- Objective: Deter price competition from larger competitors
- Audience: Two major competitors considering aggressive pricing in our niche
- Current reputation: "Promising startup, but would fold under pressure"
- Available evidence: Recent funding round, one successful price war survival, strong customer retention

**Output:**

## Reputation Strategy: Price War Deterrence

### Target Perception
**Audience:** Two major competitors (MegaCorp, BigTech) watching our segment
**Desired belief:** "They will match any price cut and sustain losses longer than it's worth. Attacking their segment is expensive and pointless."
**Current belief:** "They're a startup. Enough pressure and they'll fold or sell."
**Gap:** They think we're vulnerable. We need them to think we're stubborn and well-resourced.

### Consistent Behaviors to Establish
| Situation | Required Action | Message Sent |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| Competitor undercuts price | Match within 48 hours, publicly announce | "We will not cede on price, ever" |
| Customer threatens to leave for cheaper option | Match price for loyal customers; let price-only customers go | "Our customers stay; price isn't our weakness" |
| Press asks about competitive pressure | "We welcome competition. Our customers choose us for reasons beyond price." | Confidence, not fear |
| Competitor sales rep disparages us | Never respond directly; let customer retention speak | Dignified strength |

### Evidence Building Plan
| Action | Audience Reached | Timeline | Verifiability |
|--------|------------------|----------|---------------|
| Publish 18-month runway publicly (via press) | Competitors, analysts | This quarter | Press article, funding verification |
| Match competitor's pilot pricing in 3 accounts | Competitor sales team | Ongoing | They'll hear from prospects |
| Customer case study: "Why we stayed during competitor discount" | Market broadly | Next quarter | Published, quotable |
| Hire away one senior person from competitor | Competitor internally | 6 months | They'll notice |

### Distribution Strategy
**Who tells your story:**
- Customers who rejected competitor discounts
- Industry analysts who cover the space
- Competitor sales reps frustrated by our response speed
- Our own investors (who talk to theirs)

**How they learn it:**
- Direct experience (sales encounters)
- Analyst reports and market commentary
- Industry conference conversations
- Board/investor network gossip

**Key proof points:**
- "They matched our price in 24 hours"
- "Their customer retention is 95%+ even during the discount period"
- "They just raised $X at strong valuation - they can sustain this"

### Absolute Commitments
- **Always:** Match price moves in our core segment within 48 hours
- **Always:** Publicly confirm funding runway at least annually
- **Never:** Let a competitor win a deal solely on price without response
- **Never:** Show desperation or fear in any communication
- **Never:** Negotiate from weakness or mention competitive pressure as concern

### Reputation Test
Reputation is established when:
1. Competitors stop leading with price discounts against us
2. Industry analysts describe our segment as "defended" or "sticky"
3. Customers tell us: "They said you'd match it anyway"
4. Competitor job candidates say: "I've heard you guys don't back down"

## Anti-Patterns

**DON'T:**
- Make threats you won't follow through on
- Boast about capabilities - let evidence speak
- Respond to every slight (dignified silence has power)
- Let one exception destroy consistent pattern
- Claim a reputation you haven't earned
- Confuse fame with strategic reputation

**REPUTATION DESTROYERS:**
- "We said we would but then we didn't" - One broken commitment
- "They backed down when pressured" - Visible capitulation
- "All talk, no action" - Claims without evidence
- "They're inconsistent" - Different responses to same situation
- "Everyone knows their threats are empty" - Pattern of non-follow-through

---

## The Consistency Imperative

> "One city shown mercy after resistance will cause ten cities to resist. One threat not carried out will ensure no threat is believed."

Reputation is fragile. Years of consistent behavior can be destroyed by one inconsistent response. Before making any commitment (promise or threat), ask:

1. Am I willing to follow through in the worst case?
2. Is this sustainable across all similar situations?
3. What happens if they test me?

If you're not certain, don't make the commitment.

## Integration

This skill pairs with:
- **Intelligence Network Design:** Know how your reputation is perceived before acting
- **Victory Without Battle (Sun Tzu):** Reputation enables winning without fighting
- **Crisis Rhetoric (Churchill):** Communicating during reputation-defining moments
